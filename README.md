This project is Panic Attack Detection System based on physiological signals such as heart rate and breathing speed. This explores multiple machine learning models and deep learning techniques to classify whether a person is experiencing a panic attack
___
Key Features:
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data visualization and preprocessing using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
  Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling (StandardScaler, RobustScaler), handling imbalanced data using SMOTE.
  Deep Learning (ANN) Model:
    Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras (Sequential model).
    Layers include Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization, and Conv1D (indicating possible CNN integration).
    Optimized using Adam optimizer, EarlyStopping, and ModelCheckpoint.
